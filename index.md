# I have Crohn's

### I believe big money has no common sense and even less forward thinking.

#### Currently, everything that we consume has to be approved by the food and drug industry.
Which they have created their own laws [Canada's Food and Drugs Act and Regulations](
https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/legislation-guidelines/acts-regulations/canada-food-drugs.html)

#### So what does this have to do with having Crohn's you may ask?

I believe that our food and drug system has many major flaws:

  1. If a food or drug has been tested for a short time with a small group of people it may prove that 
it is safe for a short time and for a small group of people; but it may not prove that the food or drug
can be harmful for a large group of people in the long run. 

Secondly, when something is being tested, 
it is being paid for by those that want the food or drug tests to succeed. 
For the tests to be fair, there should be apposing tests that are not controlled nor funded by
the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy 

    * I believe that the people should have some say in what they are consuming and I
    hope that all products, food and drug, will one day have a public database which isn't
    hosted by big money that gives people a way to give their feedback in a professional and 
    precise manner. 









#### DRAFT, BRAINSTORMING, TO INSPIRE ME LATER
Some companies are now saying and suing health products because they are claiming that they are good for a sore throat for example and they are getting sued because only drugs can be good for sore throats.

I wonder if anyone could legally put an end to this as this is only to limit products and raise prices of healthy products.

(1) Maybe there is a way to legally state this is a food/health product that is good for sore throats. In such a way that they are legally safe?

(2) They say that health products have to prove their claims; and I wonder if it is possible to make a country wide data base that customers can join and be a part of the research and part of the proof that these health care products require.

(3) Obviously, these ideas are off the top of my head, but I would hope one day that someone would care enough to create a way to gather proof for products that are not made to treat the symptom and more focus on products that reduce the cause of the issue in the first place.

(4) Obviously, big money has no common sense and there has to be a way to inject common sense back into the minds of those that are looking for additional help.

(5) For example: in the UK it was discovered that cows milk could contain crohns or something like that. But since this information doesn't make anyone rich it just gets forgotten and very hard to find when researching. Wouldn't it be nice if the "people" could say, we haven't done research on 1000 people but we have a data base of millions that can confirm that there doctors report this when they have done something like limit cows milk in said country?

(6) I believe that we are eating foods that were sprayed with a poison that is actually causing harm to our dna. There is so much money to be made in farming using poisons as they don't have to hire people to tend to the crops and because they get a much greater yeald. But shouldn't common sense trump over profit?

It almost feels like money is spent on creating illnesses, and then profit is made from selling the product that reduces the symptoms; when will it be obvous that it better to spend our money and time making a healthier world?

Currently, there is no way for things to change for the better and I have know idea what would be needed for the world to become a better place, and hopefully this might be the place that inspires common sense best practices for our land, food, air and water.
