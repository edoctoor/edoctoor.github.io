Some companies are now saying and suing health products because
they are claiming that they are good for a sore throat for example and
they are getting sued because only drugs can be good for sore throats.

I wonder if anyone could legally put an end to this as
this is only to limit products and raise prices of healthy
products. 

(1) Maybe there is a way to legally state this is a food/health product
that is good for sore throats. In such a way that they are legally safe?

(2) They say that health products have to prove their claims; and I wonder
if it is possible to make a country wide data base that customers can
join and be a part of the research and part of the proof that these
health care products require.

(3) Obviously, these ideas are off the top of my head, but 
I would hope one day that someone would care enough to
create a way to gather proof for products that are not
made to treat the symptom and more focus on products that
reduce the cause of the issue in the first place.

(4) Obviously, big money has no common sense and there
has to be a way to inject common sense back into the 
minds of those that are looking for additional help.

(5) For example: in the UK it was discovered that cows milk
could contain crohns or something like that. But since 
this information doesn't make anyone rich it just gets forgotten
and very hard to find when researching. 
Wouldn't it be nice if the "people" could say, we haven't done
research on 1000 people but we have a data base of millions that
can confirm that there doctors report this when they have done 
something like limit cows milk in said country?

(6) I believe that we are eating foods that were sprayed with 
a poison that is actually causing harm to our dna. 
There is so much money to be made in farming using poisons 
as they don't have to hire people to tend to the crops and
because they get a much greater yeald. 
But shouldn't common sense trump over profit?

It almost feels like money is spent on creating illnesses, and
then profit is made from selling the product that reduces the 
symptoms; when will it be obvous that it better to spend our
money and time making a healthier world?

Currently, there is no way for things to change for the better
and I have know idea what would be needed for the world to become a better
place, and hopefully this might be the place that inspires
common sense best practices for our land, food, air and water.
